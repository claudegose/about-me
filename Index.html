        <h3>A funny story </h3>
        <p align="center">During High School, my mother believed that the household should be run like a dictatorship and therefor I had to work for anything I wanted, so it came time to buy my first car when I was 16, I didnt have the money at the time so I thought of ways in which I could make an honest income as quick as possible, since everyone was either selling Chocolates or Drugs, I decied to take a more ethical approach to earing the money for my first car, so i went around the neighborhood to see what items people threw out, because people love throwing things out in the US. I stumbled apon a box full of first issue PlayBoy magazines. I knew this would be able to rack the big bucks since our network at school was proxied and kids needed something to look at.
            So, I took 20 of these beautifu magazines to school with me and sold them all out on that same day, ended up getting in trouble for selling explicit magazines at school, but my principle was proud of me for taking an entrepreneurial mindset with me to school.</p>
